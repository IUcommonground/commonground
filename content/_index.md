This year's theme is **Media Studies in/at/from the Margins.**
This iteration of the titular conference considers what has traditionally been left out, neglected, or sidelined in media studies. By considering what is on the margins rather than at the heart of media studies, we hope to create a space that generates vibrant debate over what media studies can be as opposed to what it “is.” Rather than trying to locate origins for this hyperdynamic and multipronged field, therefore, we embrace its messiness and incoherence. Yet this mess cannot be uninvestigated. Sifting through the multiple possibilities embedded in the margins, we consider what sits outside the gamut of normative discipline, canon, geography, form, theory and ideology. What gets left in the marginalia, uninvestigated, unsituated and noninstitutionalized? In writing in/at and from themargins of media studies, what fresh insights can we bring to our field(s).
