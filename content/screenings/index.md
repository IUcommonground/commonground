**Dana Kirk**, “Changelog,” WIP, (2024) *Indiana University, Bloomington*
>Changelog explores the experience of growing up on the internet and its implications in navigating socialization offline. It’s about change and how the meaning of change changes when change is logged. It’s a template for others to project their own web histories onto. It’s a confrontation and reconciliation with fragmented identity. This is a story of someone trying to tell their story without wanting to really tell it. Someone who has best understood the self through documentation, further documenting the self, but not quite divulging.
Changelog’s composition is sometimes wonky and misaligned, refractive with information and reflections, edited with the impatient cuts of a Youtube vlog, accented by the palpable clacking of keyboard keys. Rather than simply emulate the chaos of the internet, I want the audience to feel what it feels like to exist online. There is chaos and there is also solitude and quiet and remnants of memory. All while keys click.

**Jack Bassett**, “Kuehnert Dairy” (2024)*Indiana University, Bloomington*
> In Fort Wayne, Indiana for the last 125 years, the Kuehnert Family has bottled endless memories and gallon after gallon of milk. Now a new generation of Kuehnert Dairy Farmers have taken over things and have added a direct cow-to-consumer means of enjoyment. Entitled: “The Milk House”, the family’s new venture provides milk lovers with calcium-protein-rich natural dairy creations sold on the site the milk came from. Milk, Cheese, Butter, Ice Cream, and more are made from Kuehnert cows. The fifth-generation owner: Andrew Kuehnert aims to continue to grow agritourism with his family farm through the Milk House. The Kuehnert’s and their 300-plus cows are bringing in visitors to see how their operation works and tasting the farm’s dairy creations. This dairy showcases hows to illustrate the moo-ivng message of how hard work, passion, and reimagining a family tradition can keep a pillar business alive for the next generation.

**Adam Ritchie Carroll**, “Mundane” (2024) *Indiana University, Bloomington*

**Ahmed Tahsin Shams**, “Truth, Power, and Freedom” (2025)
>“The documentary film Truth Power and Freedom (11mins, 2025) captures the journey of Eric, a young Ghana-born American artist, as he navigates the complexities of identity, belonging, and artistic expression in the USA. Blending mixed media—canvas painting, music video aesthetics, and line art animation—the film attempts a blend of immersiveness and, at the same time, the Brechtian V-effect in Eric’s evolving creative process. His brushstrokes breathe life into historical figures like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Emmett Till, reimagining them through his art as voices that refuse to be silenced. As the camera follows Eric crafting a new painting, his reflections on community, memory, and resistance unfold, shaping not only his canvas but the very essence of his identity.”

**Weihong Zheng**, “The Diagrams of Sheshan Observatory” *University of Washington Seattle*
