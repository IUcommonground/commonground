**Dana Kirk**, “Changelog,” (2024) *Indiana University, Bloomington*
>Changelog explores the experience of growing up on the internet and its implications in navigating socialization offline. It’s about change and how the meaning of change changes when change is logged. It’s a template for others to project their own web histories onto. It’s a confrontation and reconciliation with fragmented identity. This is a story of someone trying to tell their story without wanting to really tell it. Someone who has best understood the self through documentation, further documenting the self, but not quite divulging.
Changelog’s composition is sometimes wonky and misaligned, refractive with information and reflections, edited with the impatient cuts of a Youtube vlog, accented by the palpable clacking of keyboard keys. Rather than simply emulate the chaos of the internet, I want the audience to feel what it feels like to exist online. There is chaos and there is also solitude and quiet and remnants of memory. All while keys click.

**Jack Bassett**, “Kuehnert Dairy” (2024) *Indiana University, Bloomington*
> In Fort Wayne, Indiana for the last 125 years, the Kuehnert Family has bottled endless memories and gallon after gallon of milk. Now a new generation of Kuehnert Dairy Farmers have taken over things and have added a direct cow-to-consumer means of enjoyment. Entitled: “The Milk House”, the family’s new venture provides milk lovers with calcium-protein-rich natural dairy creations sold on the site the milk came from. Milk, Cheese, Butter, Ice Cream, and more are made from Kuehnert cows. The fifth-generation owner: Andrew Kuehnert aims to continue to grow agritourism with his family farm through the Milk House. The Kuehnert’s and their 300-plus cows are bringing in visitors to see how their operation works and tasting the farm’s dairy creations. This dairy showcases hows to illustrate the moo-ivng message of how hard work, passion, and reimagining a family tradition can keep a pillar business alive for the next generation.

**Adam Ritchie Carroll**, “Mundane” (2024) *Indiana University, Bloomington*
>Is it a routine or mundanity? How does your daily life play out, how do you pass the time?

**Ruby Berin**, “A Moment in Time” *Indiana University, Bloomington*
>My film, A Moment in Time, was made in the spring 2024 semester in my production practicum class. In this class, we were able to work with different communities/organizations around Indiana before the Eclipse in April 2024. I chose to work with the Indiana Forest Alliance, and they put on a 2-day viewing during the weekend of the eclipse at Yellowwood State Forest and at the Tibetan Mongolian Cultural Center. They paid homage to the state's beautiful and unique forest ecosystems with a time capsule dedication, live music, crafts, presentations, hikes, and food. Attached is a photo of funding with the Microgrant Awardees. [link here for more information](https://rural.indiana.edu/focus/arts-culture/eclipse/eclipse-awardee-projects.html)

**Michael Yang**, “Snow Blindness” *School of the Art Institute of Chicago*
>Snow Blindness is an interdisciplinary art installation and performance piece that explores themes of technology, self-expression, and intimacy. Drawing on the phenomenon of snow blindness—a condition where one’s vision is overwhelmed in environments lacking focal points—the project translates this concept into a metaphor for the disorienting effects of digital communication. By layering personal recordings, reactive lighting, and real-time video distortion, this installation examines the often incomplete or distorted expressions of self in intimate relationships, mediated through technology.

**Holden Brown**, “My Favorite Pair” *Indiana University, Bloomington* (2024)
> It is an easy-going video of friends and family's favorite pair of shoes that highlights individuality.

**Ahmed Tahsin Shams**, “Truth, Power, and Freedom” (2025)
>This documentary film captures the journey of Eric, a young Ghana-born American artist, as he navigates the complexities of identity, belonging, and artistic expression in the USA. Blending mixed media—canvas painting, music video aesthetics, and line art animation—the film attempts a blend of immersiveness and, at the same time, the Brechtian V-effect in Eric’s evolving creative process. His brushstrokes breathe life into historical figures like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Emmett Till, reimagining them through his art as voices that refuse to be silenced. As the camera follows Eric crafting a new painting, his reflections on community, memory, and resistance unfold, shaping not only his canvas but the very essence of his identity.

**Weihong Zheng**, “The Diagrams of Sheshan Observatory” *University of Washington, Seattle*

**Brian Johnson,** "I Can't Stop" *Indiana University, Bloomington* (2024)
>Originally created for my fall semester Production Practicum, this film uses a combination of self-shot and found footage. I chose to make this short a personal essay about the constant pressure to push myself using motion as the driving force behind the scenes.
