      <description>Ramon Resendiz 1:30pm, Franklin Hall, Room 310
Dr. Ramón Resendiz is a Xicanx documentary media producer and visual anthropologist from the south Texas borderlands. His research interrogates the material and imaginary intersections of systemic violence, national borders, memory, visual culture, and settler colonialism. He investigates the erasure of Indigenous peoples and how modern nation states are visualized by archival institutions across the Texas/U.S. and northern Mexico border landscapes, and the ways memory workers and cultural producers render these erasures visible.</description>

<p><strong>1:30pm, Franklin Hall, Room 310</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7475396/bio/">Dr. Ramón Resendiz</a> is a Xicanx documentary media producer and visual anthropologist from the south Texas borderlands. His research interrogates the material and imaginary intersections of systemic violence, national borders, memory, visual culture, and settler colonialism. He investigates the erasure of Indigenous peoples and how modern nation states are visualized by archival institutions across the Texas/U.S. and northern Mexico border landscapes, and the ways memory workers and cultural producers render these erasures visible.</p>
<p>He has produced multiple collaborative documentaries including, Voces del Norte: <em>Mariachi Quinto Sol de UW</em> (2016), <em>El Muro | The Wall</em> (2017), and <em>Migrant: A Reflection from Thundercloud</em> (2019). He holds a Ph.D. in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University and is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Research on Race &amp; Society at Indiana University.</p>
<h2 id="cory-doctorow">Cory Doctorow</h2>
<p><strong>4pm, Franklin Hall, Room 310</strong> or <a href="https://iu.zoom.us/meeting/register/Potbwk7eTlyoeYwaZRr7rw">Link to zoom here</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> is a science fiction author, digital rights activist, and journalist. His most recent nonfiction book is <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/721311/the-internet-con-by-cory-doctorow/">The Internet Con: How to Seize The Means of Internet Computation</a> (2023) a Big Tech disassembly manual. He is also the author of [Chokepoint Capitalism] (<a href="https://chokepointcapitalism.com/">https://chokepointcapitalism.com/</a>) (with Rebecca Giblin) (2023), about creative labor markets and monopoly; <a href="https://craphound.com/category/destroy/">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</a> (2020)</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow will keynote the Media School Graduate Association’s Common Ground conference, presenting on his concept of <strong>“enshittification.”</strong></p>
<p>Coined the “2023 Digital Word of the Year,” enshittification describes the process by which internet media platforms become simultaneously unusable and un-quittable.</p>
<p><em>Enshittification</em> swept through the digital world over the past decade, and it has only accelerated since, as everything - grocery stores, nursing agencies, even public schools - became digital services. The more digital something is, the more vulnerable it is to enshittification.<em>Enshittification</em> isn’t a force of nature. It’s not a historic inevitability. It’s the eminently foreseeable result of specific policy choices made by named individuals in living memory, after these individuals were warned that enshittification would ensue. Enshittification was a choice, not an accident.</p>
<p>The choices that led to enshittification are not graven in stone. They are just that - <em>choices</em>. We can choose otherwise. Indeed, we <em>must</em>, if we are to have an internet that is fit for purpose and can serve as the digital nervous system that we can use to coordinate our survival in a 21st century beset by genocide, ecological collapse, and economic chaos.</p>
<p>What policy choices can we make? What path can get us to those choices? How do we end the enshittocene and build a new, good internet?</p>

      <description>Film Screening will be at 7pm in the Commons of Franklin Hall Dana Kirk, “Changelog,” WIP, (2024) Indiana University, Bloomington
Changelog explores the experience of growing up on the internet and its implications in navigating socialization offline. It’s about change and how the meaning of change changes when change is logged. It’s a template for others to project their own web histories onto. It’s a confrontation and reconciliation with fragmented identity.</description>

<p><strong>Dana Kirk</strong>, “Changelog,” WIP, (2024) <em>Indiana University, Bloomington</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changelog explores the experience of growing up on the internet and its implications in navigating socialization offline. It’s about change and how the meaning of change changes when change is logged. It’s a template for others to project their own web histories onto. It’s a confrontation and reconciliation with fragmented identity. This is a story of someone trying to tell their story without wanting to really tell it. Someone who has best understood the self through documentation, further documenting the self, but not quite divulging.
Changelog’s composition is sometimes wonky and misaligned, refractive with information and reflections, edited with the impatient cuts of a Youtube vlog, accented by the palpable clacking of keyboard keys. Rather than simply emulate the chaos of the internet, I want the audience to feel what it feels like to exist online. There is chaos and there is also solitude and quiet and remnants of memory. All while keys click.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jack Bassett</strong>, “Kuehnert Dairy” (2024)<em>Indiana University, Bloomington</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Fort Wayne, Indiana for the last 125 years, the Kuehnert Family has bottled endless memories and gallon after gallon of milk. Now a new generation of Kuehnert Dairy Farmers have taken over things and have added a direct cow-to-consumer means of enjoyment. Entitled: “The Milk House”, the family’s new venture provides milk lovers with calcium-protein-rich natural dairy creations sold on the site the milk came from. Milk, Cheese, Butter, Ice Cream, and more are made from Kuehnert cows. The fifth-generation owner: Andrew Kuehnert aims to continue to grow agritourism with his family farm through the Milk House. The Kuehnert’s and their 300-plus cows are bringing in visitors to see how their operation works and tasting the farm’s dairy creations. This dairy showcases hows to illustrate the moo-ivng message of how hard work, passion, and reimagining a family tradition can keep a pillar business alive for the next generation.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Ritchie Carroll</strong>, “Mundane” (2024) <em>Indiana University, Bloomington</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it a routine or mundanity? How does your daily life play out, how do you pass the time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ruby Berin</strong>, “A Moment in Time” <em>Indiana University, Bloomington</em> <br>
<strong>Michael Yang</strong>, “Snow Blindness” <em>School of the Art Institute of Chicago</em> <br>
<strong>Holden Brown</strong>, “My Favorite Pair” <br>
<strong>Ahmed Tahsin Shams</strong>, “Truth, Power, and Freedom” (2025)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The documentary film Truth Power and Freedom (11mins, 2025) captures the journey of Eric, a young Ghana-born American artist, as he navigates the complexities of identity, belonging, and artistic expression in the USA. Blending mixed media—canvas painting, music video aesthetics, and line art animation—the film attempts a blend of immersiveness and, at the same time, the Brechtian V-effect in Eric’s evolving creative process. His brushstrokes breathe life into historical figures like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Emmett Till, reimagining them through his art as voices that refuse to be silenced. As the camera follows Eric crafting a new painting, his reflections on community, memory, and resistance unfold, shaping not only his canvas but the very essence of his identity.”</p>
