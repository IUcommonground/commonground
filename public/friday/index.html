<h2 id="cory-doctorow">Cory Doctorow</h2>
<p><strong>4pm, Location: Franklin Hall, Room 310</strong> or <a href="https://iu.zoom.us/meeting/register/Potbwk7eTlyoeYwaZRr7rw">Link to zoom here</a></p>
<p>Science fiction author, digital rights activist, and journalist Cory Doctorow will keynote the Media School Graduate Association’s Common Ground conference, presenting on his concept of “enshittification.”</p>
<p>Coined the “2023 Digital Word of the Year,” enshittification describes the process by which internet media platforms become simultaneously unusable and un-quittable.</p>
<p>Enshittification swept through the digital world over the past decade, and it has only accelerated since, as everything - grocery stores, nursing agencies, even public schools - became digital services. The more digital something is, the more vulnerable it is to enshittification.</p>
<p>Enshittification isn’t a force of nature. It’s not a historic inevitability. It’s the eminently foreseeable result of specific policy choices made by named individuals in living memory, after these individuals were warned that enshittification would ensue. Enshittification was a choice, not an accident.</p>
<p>The choices that led to enshittification are not graven in stone. They are just that - <em>choices</em>. We can choose otherwise. Indeed, we <em>must</em>, if we are to have an internet that is fit for purpose and can serve as the digital nervous system that we can use to coordinate our survival in a 21st century beset by genocide, ecological collapse, and economic chaos.</p>
<p>What policy choices can we make? What path can get us to those choices? How do we end the enshittocene and build a new, good internet?</p>
